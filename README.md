**Executive Summary**
This report provides an analysis of historical unemployment data in Sweden from 2019 to 2024. The aim is to identify patterns, relationships, and trends based on gender, age, country of birth, and time without a job. We also explore the years with the highest and lowest unemployment ratios and provide projections for the upcoming year.

**Introduction**
Unemployment is a critical economic indicator that affects both individuals and the broader economy. Understanding the dynamics of unemployment can help in formulating policies to mitigate its effects. This report examines the historical unemployment data in Sweden to uncover key insights and trends.


**Methodology**
Data was sourced from the website of Arbetsförmedlingen (Swedish Public Employment Service), which contains detailed records of unemployment statistics from 2019 to 2024. 
For a detailed information they have premade visuals and statistics you can find here. For this analysis I have chosen to filter on: people that are signed up at Arbetsförmedlingen -> openly without a job, period between 2019-04 and 2024-09, both man and woman, age groups: 18–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–64, born in: Sweden, Europe (but not Sweden) and outside of Europe and without a job between: lesser than 6 months, between 6 and 12 months, between 12 and 24 months and longer than 24 months.
The analysis involved:
- Mapping categorical variables to numeric values for consistency.
- Filtering and aggregating the data based on various parameters.
- Visualizing trends and relationships through charts and tables.

**Accuracy**
- Ensemble Model Accuracy: 0.82
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier Accuracy: 0.81
- Best Cross-Validation Score: 0.81
